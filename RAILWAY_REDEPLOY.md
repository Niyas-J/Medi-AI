# Railway Redeploy Instructions

## Issue
Railway is showing errors about missing `openai` module. This is because Railway is deploying from an older commit.

## Solution

The latest code (commit `e69de00`) has already removed all OpenAI dependencies. Railway just needs to pull the latest changes.

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy (Recommended)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app
2. **Select Your Project**: Medi-AI
3. **Go to Deployments Tab**
4. **Click "Redeploy"** or **"Deploy Latest"**
5. Railway will pull the latest commit from GitHub and rebuild

### Option 2: Trigger with Empty Commit

If Railway doesn't automatically detect the changes, trigger a new deployment:

```bash
cd medi-ai-suite
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Railway redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Check Railway Settings

1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Settings
2. Check **"Source"** - should be connected to `Niyas-J/Medi-AI`
3. Check **"Branch"** - should be `main`
4. Click **"Redeploy"**

## Verify Deployment

After redeployment, check the build logs. You should see:

✅ **No OpenAI errors**  
✅ **No API key warnings**  
✅ **Successful build with Docker**  

### Expected Build Output:
```
Building Dockerfile
Step 1/10 : FROM python:3.11-slim
Step 2/10 : WORKDIR /app
...
Successfully built and deployed!
```

### Test Endpoints:
- Health: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health`
- Chat: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/chat`

## Latest Commit Info

**Commit**: `e69de00`  
**Message**: "Remove all API key dependencies - App runs standalone without external services"  
**Changes**: Removed all OpenAI code and API key requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing OpenAI errors?

1. **Check Railway is using latest commit**:
   - Go to Deployments → View deployment
   - Check commit hash matches `e69de00`

2. **Force rebuild**:
   - Railway Dashboard → Settings
   - Click "Clear Build Cache"
   - Click "Redeploy"

3. **Verify Dockerfile**:
   - Railway should use the Dockerfile at project root
   - Not Nixpacks (which was removed)

### Environment Variables

No API keys are required now! But you can optionally set:
- `AI_CHAT_URL` - For external AI service (optional)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - For location services (optional)

All other API keys have been removed.

**Status**: ✅ Code is ready - just needs Railway to deploy latest commit  
**Action Required**: Redeploy on Railway dashboard
