# Medi-AI Suite Architecture

## System Overview
The Medi-AI Suite is a comprehensive healthtech application built as a monorepo with multiple platforms and services.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Mobile Application (React Native/Expo)
- **Platform**: iOS and Android
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Key Features**:
  - Camera integration for wound detection
  - Barcode scanning for medicine identification
  - Real-time chat with AI
  - Emergency response system
  - Appointment management
  - Offline-first architecture

### 2. Web Application (React + Capacitor)
- **Platform**: Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Framework**: React with Capacitor
- **Features**: Similar to mobile with web-specific adaptations
- **Service Worker**: Offline support and caching

### 3. Backend Services (Flask)
- **Framework**: Python Flask
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for ML processing
- **ML Models**: TensorFlow/PyTorch for wound analysis
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage for images

### 4. Cloud Infrastructure (Firebase)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Functions**: Cloud Functions for triggers
- **Messaging**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

### 5. Blockchain (Optional)
- **Network**: Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- **Purpose**: Hash verification for medical records
- **Smart Contract**: RecordHash.sol

## Data Flow

```
1. User captures image/scan
2. Mobile app uploads to Firebase Storage
3. Flask API processes with ML models
4. Results stored in Firestore
5. Real-time updates via Firebase listeners
6. Optional: Hash stored on blockchain
```

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Auth for user management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT tokens for API authentication

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance
- Audit logging for all operations
- Secure API endpoints with CORS

### Privacy
- Local data encryption
- Minimal data collection
- User consent management
